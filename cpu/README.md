# The CPU

The heart of the Game Boy is a custom 8-bit **Sharp LR35902**. Although there are many different chips in the Game Boy, the LR35902 is the heart of the device. Almost all hardware in the Game Boy cannot be directly manipulated so the CPU must be used by the developer to control video, sound ect.

Because the LR35902 is an unique chip manufactured for Nintendo there was very little documentation released to the puiblic. Luckily it is almost identical to the **[Zilog Z80](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80)** and **[Intel 8080](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080)**, two popular microprocessors released in the 70s.
