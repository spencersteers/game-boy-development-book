# CPU

The heart of the Game Boy is a custom 8-bit *Sharp LR35902*. Although there are many different chips in the Game Boy, the *LR35902* is the heart of the device. Almost all of the Game Boy hardware cannot be directly manipulated so the CPU is used by the developer to control video, sound ect.


Because the *LR35902* is an unique chip manufactured for Nintendo there is very little documentation. Luckily it is almost identical to the [Zilog Z80](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) and [Intel 8080](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080), two popular microprocessors.
